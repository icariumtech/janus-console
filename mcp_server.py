"""
FastMCP HTTP server for the JANUS GM campaign AI.

Exposes tools at http://<host>:8001/mcp/ over HTTP transport.
Delegates all logic to the Django REST API at DJANGO_BASE_URL.

This module is standalone — it does NOT import Django or manage.py.
Runtime dependencies: fastmcp, httpx (see requirements.txt).

INTENTIONALLY UNAUTHENTICATED: Trust-network model (D-09). The MCP service
runs on the same homelab Docker network as the Django app. Do not expose
port 8001 to the public internet.
