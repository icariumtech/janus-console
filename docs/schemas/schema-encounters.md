# Encounter / Deckplan Schema Reference

All MCP paths are relative to `data/`. Slash convention: forward-slash only, no leading slash.

---

## Purpose

Deckplan YAML describes grid-based interior maps used by `EncounterMapDisplay`. Optional for
any location. When present, the GM Console renders a tactical encounter map with rooms, doors,
and POIs. A single `deckplan.yaml` holds all decks for a location.

---

## MCP Path Conventions

Deckplans live under the location they describe:

| Location type | MCP path |
|---|---|
| Mobile ship | `ships/<ship-slug>/deckplan.yaml` |
| Galaxy location | `galaxy/<system>/<body>/<slug>/deckplan.yaml` |
| Player ship | `campaign/ship/deckplan.yaml` |

The legacy `map/manifest.yaml` + per-deck `map/*.yaml` format was removed in Phase 29. All
locations must use `deckplan.yaml`. Skills should write `deckplan.yaml` only.

MCP write: `write_file("ships/patrol_gunboat/deckplan.yaml", content)`

### Editing a single element (preferred for small changes)

To change one room, corridor, or door — or to add/remove a POI — use the targeted tools instead
of rewriting the whole file. They edit server-side, so you never load the entire deckplan.

- `find_map_element(deckplan, query)` → candidate elements `[{id, kind, label, deck}]`. Use to
  disambiguate. `query` may be an id, a room/corridor name, or a glob (`coolant_tanks*`).
- `edit_map_element(deckplan, target, set | add_poi | remove_poi)` → edits the one element that
  `target` resolves to. Provide exactly one operation per call.

```text
edit_map_element(dp, "mess_hall", add_poi={icon: airlock, label: Airlock, position: {x: 1, y: 1}})
edit_map_element(dp, "coolant_tanks", set={label_offset: [0, 2]})   # 409 w/ candidates if >1 -> ask the GM
edit_map_element(dp, "mess_hall__main_corridor__0", set={status: LOCKED})   # a door
```

Element ids: rooms/corridors use their slug id (`mess_hall`, `main_corridor`); colliding names get
a numeric suffix (`coolant_tanks`, `coolant_tanks_2`). Doors are addressed by the derived id
`<roomA>__<roomB>__<index>` (or `<room>__exterior__<index>` for an exterior door) — the same id used
for door-status. POIs are reached through their room (`add_poi`/`remove_poi`), never targeted directly.

**P-edit — Do NOT `read_file` + `write_file` to change one element.** That reloads the whole
deckplan for a one-field edit. Use `edit_map_element`; if the reference is ambiguous it returns the
candidates so you can ask the GM which one.

## Top-level Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hull` | mapping | no | Shared/manifest hull outline — see **Hull fields** below |
| `decks` | list | yes | List of deck entries |

### Hull fields

A hull mapping (top-level or per-deck, see below) accepts:

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `polygon` | list | no | Single outer polygon: `[[x,y],...]` in grid cells |
| `polygons` | list | no | Multiple disjoint outer polygons: `[[[x,y],...],...]` — pods, nacelles, detached modules |
| `holes` | list | no | Polygons subtracted from the hull fill via SVG fill-rule evenodd; not paired to any specific outer polygon |

`polygon` and `polygons` may both appear on the same hull — they combine into one polygon list
(shared silhouette + disjoint modules). At least one of `polygon`/`polygons` must be present for
the hull to render.

### Deck entry fields

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique deck identifier |
| `name` | string | yes | Display name |
| `level` | integer | yes | Sort key — 1 = lowest deck |
| `default` | boolean | no | First deck shown on load |
| `unit_size` | integer | no | Pixels per grid cell (default 30) |
| `hull` | mapping | no | Deck-level hull (same shape as top-level, see **Hull fields**) — renders **in addition to** the top-level hull. The top-level hull is the shared silhouette drawn on every deck; a deck hull only adds geometry (pods, nacelles), it never replaces or shrinks the shared outline. |
| `rooms` | list | yes | List of room entries (see GridRoom fields) |
| `doors` | list | no | Top-level door definitions (see Door fields) |
| `vents` | list | no | Ventilation path definitions (see Vent fields) |
| `details` | list | no | Decorative detail linework (see Detail Fields) |

---

## GridRoom Fields

Each room entry in the `rooms:` list.

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique within this deck |
| `name` | string | no | Display label — empty string suppresses label; `\n` (in a double-quoted YAML string, e.g. `"CAPTAIN'S\nQUARTERS"`) renders as a line break on the map |
| `type` | string | no | `"corridor"` skips label rendering |
| `rects` | list | shape | Rectangle(s) — see rect fields |
| `polygon` | list | shape | Freeform vertices: `[[x,y], ...]` in grid cells |
| `circle` | mapping | shape | Circular room: `{cx, cy, r}` in grid cells |
| `poi` | list | no | Points of interest (see POI fields) |

Exactly one of `rects`, `polygon`, or `circle` must be present (shape field).

### Rect entry fields

| Field | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `x` | float | Top-left cell, 0-based |
| `y` | float | Top-left cell, 0-based |
| `w` | float | Width in grid cells |
| `h` | float | Height in grid cells |
| `chamfer` | float | Optional — diagonal corner cut in grid-cell units |

### Circle entry fields

| Field | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `cx` | float | Center X in grid cells |
| `cy` | float | Center Y in grid cells |
| `r` | float | Radius in grid cells |

---

## Door Fields

Doors are a **top-level `doors:` array on the deck** (same indent level as `rooms:`).
Each door names the two rooms it connects.

Two authored forms are supported:

### B-rel (relational form — preferred)

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rooms` | list | yes | Two room ids sharing an edge; one-element list = exterior door |
| `along` | float | no | Fraction 0..1 along shared edge (default 0.5 = centre) |
| `width` | float | no | Door width in grid cells (default 1) |
| `type` | enum | no | `standard \| blast_door \| airlock \| emergency \| open` |
| `status` | enum | no | `OPEN \| CLOSED \| LOCKED \| SEALED \| DAMAGED \| BROKEN` |
| `id` | string | no | Explicit stable id; auto-derived if omitted |

### B-pos (position-override form)

Use when two rooms share multiple disjoint edges, or for polygon/circle rooms where
the relational form is ambiguous.

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rooms` | list | yes | Two room ids (or one for exterior) |
| `position` | mapping | yes | `{x, y, angle}` — door center in grid coords |
| `type` | enum | no | Same enum as B-rel |
| `status` | enum | no | Same enum as B-rel |

**Position fields:**

| Field | Note |
|---|---|
| `x` | Door center X in grid cells |
| `y` | Door center Y in grid cells |
| `angle` | `0` = horizontal slot (N/S wall), `90` = vertical slot (E/W wall) |

**Door id format:** Auto-derived as `${room.id}_door_${index}` when no explicit `id:` is given.
Explicit `id:` is recommended for stable runtime door-state references.

**Door status enum:** `OPEN | CLOSED | LOCKED | SEALED | DAMAGED | BROKEN`

> `BROKEN` is a legacy alias for `DAMAGED` preserved from pre-Phase 21 maps. Use `DAMAGED` for new maps.

---

## POI Fields

POIs are entries in a room's `poi:` list. The backend auto-generates `id`, `room`, and
`position` fields from the parent room, so only `icon` is required.

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `icon` | string | yes | Lowercase name matching SVG filename prefix (see icons below) |
| `label` | string | no | Display name — shown in hover popover |
| `type` | enum | no | Controls icon color; default `item` (see types below) |
| `position` | mapping | no | `{x, y}` grid coords; omit to center on room |
| `description` | string | no | Extra detail shown in hover popover |

**POI type values and colors:**

| Type | Color | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `item` | teal | Equipment, fixtures, objects (default) |
| `objective` | amber | Mission targets, key locations |
| `hazard` | red | Dangers, environmental threats |
| `npc` | teal | NPC markers |
| `player` | teal | Player markers |

**P2 — Do not create `map/manifest.yaml` or per-deck `map/*.yaml` files.** The legacy
`map/` directory format was removed in Phase 29. The loaders `load_map`,
`load_encounter_manifest`, and `load_deck_map` no longer exist. Write `deckplan.yaml`
only — all decks inline in a single file.

**P1 — Use plain ASCII in YAML string values.** Em-dashes (`—`), curly quotes (`""`), and
backslash-escaped quotes (`\"`) inside YAML double-quoted strings cause MCP `write_file`
to fail with `-32602`. Use hyphens (`-`) and straight quotes instead. Markdown bodies
(`.md` files) tolerate Unicode fine; this restriction applies to `.yaml` files only.

### Available POI icon names

`ai`, `airlock`, `armory`, `automed`, `cabin`, `cargo`, `command`, `cryo`, `docking bay`,
`door`, `door security level 1`, `door security level 2`, `door security level 3`,
`duct access`, `elevator`, `elevator to bottom`, `elevator to top`, `emergency capsule`,
`exit`, `factory`, `fuel`, `full`, `galley`, `intercom`, `jumpdrive`, `lab`, `ladder`,
`ladder bottom`, `ladder top`, `laser`, `medbay`, `ramp`, `reactor core`, `refinery`,
`sensors`, `shower`, `space colony`, `space ship`, `space station`, `supplies`, `terminal`,
`toilet`, `toilets 2`, `vac suit`, `vault`, `ventillation`, `weapon system`, `workshop`, `empty`, `0`

> Note: `ventillation` has double-L — matches the source SVG filename exactly.

---

## Vent Fields

Vents are entries in the deck-level `vents:` list. Each vent is a multi-segment
polyline (ventilation shaft route) that the GM can reveal or hide individually.
Hidden by default — players only see a vent after the GM right-clicks it and
chooses "Reveal to players."

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique within this deck |
| `points` | list | yes | `[[x,y], ...]` polyline vertices in grid cell coords |
| `label` | string | no | Display name shown in the GM right-click menu |

**SVG layer:** `Vents` sublayer within each deck layer (multi-deck) or top-level
`Vents` layer (single-deck). Each path = one vent; `inkscape:label` → label + id.
Generated by `svg_to_map.py` automatically when the layer is present.

---

## Detail Fields

Details are entries in the deck-level `details:` list — decorative linework
(consoles, beds, furniture, machinery blocks, hull greebles) drawn in one fixed
blueprint-grade renderer style. Each entry is a polyline or a circle in grid-cell
units.

| Field | Type | Required | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | no | Optional — only needed for future editor/AI targeting |
| `room` | string | no | When present the entry is INTERIOR: players see it only once that room is revealed by the GM. When absent the entry is EXTERIOR: always visible regardless of any room's reveal state |
| `points` | list | one of | `[[x,y], ...]` polyline vertices in grid cells |
| `closed` | boolean | no | Closes the polyline into a shape |
| `circle` | mapping | one of | `{cx, cy, r}` in grid cells |
| `filled` | boolean | no | Faint fill for closed shapes only (a `closed` polyline or a circle) |

Exactly one of `points` or `circle` must be present. There are no styling fields —
stroke color and width are fixed in the renderer for a consistent blueprint look;
`filled` is the only appearance flag the format accepts.

A `room:` value matching no room on the deck renders nothing for players (fail-safe)
and is shown only to the GM, with a console warning naming the unknown room id.

**SVG layer:** `Details` sublayer within each deck layer. Phase 32's `svg_to_map.py`
emits these entries from an Inkscape "Details" sublayer, flattening curves into
polyline segments.

---

## Corridor Fields

Corridors are rooms with `type: corridor`. Define them in the `rooms:` array:

| Field | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Auto-generated `corridor_N` allowed (from svg_to_map.py output) |
| `rects` | list | Same rect format as GridRoom |
| `type` | string | Set to `"corridor"` to suppress label |

Doors connecting corridors to other rooms are defined in the top-level `doors:` array.

---

## Tooling Note

`tools/svg_to_map.py` (in the janus-console repo) generates deckplan YAML files from Inkscape SVGs.
Key flags: `--detect-doors` (outputs B-pos door entries from shared SVG edges),
`--grid-scale N` (groups N Inkscape grid cells into 1 output cell),
`--unit-size N` (pixels per output cell, default 30).

**SVG layer conventions:**

Single-deck (flat layers — backwards compatible):
- `Hull` — optional hull outline path
- `Rooms` — one `<path>` per room; `inkscape:label` = room name. A `<circle>`, a true
  `<ellipse>` (rx == ry), or an Inkscape-native `sodipodi:type="arc"` path inside
  Rooms/Corridors becomes a `circle` room/corridor. An ellipse that is not circular
  (rx != ry) is rejected with a stderr warning — never approximated; fix the shape in
  Inkscape. Circle rooms/corridors do not currently participate in polygon-based
  door-to-room adjacency (auto door-detection and doors-layer room association can only
  edge-test/contain-test polygons) — author doors touching a circle room manually via the
  Doors layer.
- `Corridors` — one `<path>` per corridor. A `<circle>`, a true `<ellipse>` (rx == ry), or an
  Inkscape-native `sodipodi:type="arc"` path inside Rooms/Corridors becomes a `circle`
  room/corridor. An ellipse that is not circular (rx != ry) is rejected with a stderr
  warning — never approximated; fix the shape in Inkscape. Circle rooms/corridors do not
  currently participate in polygon-based door-to-room adjacency (auto door-detection and
  doors-layer room association can only edge-test/contain-test polygons) — author doors
  touching a circle room manually via the Doors layer.
- `Vents` — optional; one `<path>` per vent route; `inkscape:label` = vent name

Multi-deck (nested layers — auto-detected):
- `Hull` — optional hull outline path (top-level)
- `<Deck Label>` — one layer per deck (e.g. `"Main Deck"`, `"Engineering Deck"`)
  - `Rooms` — room paths within this deck. A `<circle>`, a true `<ellipse>` (rx == ry), or an
    Inkscape-native `sodipodi:type="arc"` path inside Rooms/Corridors becomes a `circle`
    room/corridor. An ellipse that is not circular (rx != ry) is rejected with a stderr
    warning — never approximated; fix the shape in Inkscape. Circle rooms/corridors do not
    currently participate in polygon-based door-to-room adjacency (auto door-detection and
    doors-layer room association can only edge-test/contain-test polygons) — author doors
    touching a circle room manually via the Doors layer.
  - `Corridors` — corridor paths within this deck. A `<circle>`, a true `<ellipse>` (rx ==
    ry), or an Inkscape-native `sodipodi:type="arc"` path inside Rooms/Corridors becomes a
    `circle` room/corridor. An ellipse that is not circular (rx != ry) is rejected with a
    stderr warning — never approximated; fix the shape in Inkscape. Circle rooms/corridors
    do not currently participate in polygon-based door-to-room adjacency (auto
    door-detection and doors-layer room association can only edge-test/contain-test
    polygons) — author doors
    touching a circle room manually via the Doors layer.
  - `Vents` — optional vent routes within this deck

Multi-deck is triggered automatically when any top-level layer contains `Rooms` or `Corridors`
sublayers. The deck layer label becomes the deck `id` (snake-cased) and `name`. All decks are
written to a single `deckplan.yaml` at the location root. The first deck gets `default: true`.
The `--deck` flag is only used in single-deck mode.

The MCP `upload_svg_map` tool and `/janus-import-deckplan` skill both support multi-deck SVGs —
a single upload/import can populate all decks at once. On upload, the original SVG is stored in
`campaign/images/sources/<filename>` (alongside portrait sources) for future re-conversion, while
the generated `deckplan.yaml` is written to the target location root.

Skills do NOT run this tool — it is a manual GM workflow for converting hand-drawn maps.

## Example

Two-room deckplan with one connecting door:

```yaml
decks:
  - id: main_deck
    name: Main Deck
    level: 1
    default: true
    unit_size: 30
    rooms:
      - id: bridge
        name: "BRIDGE"
        rects:
          - { x: 1, y: 0, w: 5, h: 3 }

      - id: airlock
        name: "AIRLOCK"
        rects:
          - { x: 6, y: 0, w: 2, h: 3 }
        poi:
          - icon: airlock
            label: "Tender Dock - Shepherd-7"
            type: objective
            description: "Docking clamp, currently sealed"

    doors:
      - rooms: [bridge, airlock]
        along: 0.5
        type: standard
        status: CLOSED
```
