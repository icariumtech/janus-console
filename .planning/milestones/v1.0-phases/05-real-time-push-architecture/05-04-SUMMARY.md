# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 05-01
    provides: "In-memory ActiveView state store + SSE broadcaster + /api/active-view/stream/ endpoint"
  - phase: 05-02
    provides: "All 17 GM write endpoints announce SSE events via broadcaster.announce()"
  - phase: 05-03
    provides: "useSSE hook + SSEConnectionToast + SharedConsole/GMConsole wired to SSE"
provides:
  - "Human verification that end-to-end real-time push pipeline works correctly"
  - "Documented pass/fail for all 7 behavioral test scenarios"

# Phase 5 Plan 04: Human Verification Checkpoint Summary

**End-to-end verification plan for SSE push architecture replacing 2-second ActiveView polling with instant server-sent events**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~2 min (pre-checks only; human verification confirmed 2026-03-06)
- **Started:** 2026-02-22T00:24:43Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22T00:26:00Z (checkpoint reached)
- **Tasks:** 0 automated (1 checkpoint task awaiting human)
- **Files modified:** 0

## Accomplishments

- Confirmed SSE URL `/api/active-view/stream/` is registered and reversible in Django
- Confirmed `setInterval` in SharedConsole is message-bridge polling only (not active-view polling) — no vestiges of old 2s active-view polling
- Confirmed `setInterval` in GMConsole is channel-unread polling only (not active-view polling)
- Confirmed migration `0017_delete_activeview` is applied — SQLite ActiveView table removed
- Confirmed production build passes with no TypeScript errors

## Task Commits

No automated tasks — this plan is a pure human verification checkpoint.

**Plan metadata commit:** (pending — will be committed after human verification approved)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/05-real-time-push-architecture/05-04-SUMMARY.md` — This summary

## Decisions Made

None — this is a verification-only plan. Implementation decisions were made in plans 05-01 through 05-03.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written (no automated tasks, single checkpoint task).

## Automated Pre-Check Results

| Check | Expected | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|
| SSE URL registered | `/api/active-view/stream/` | PASS |
| SharedConsole `setInterval` | Messages only (not active-view) | PASS |
| GMConsole `setInterval` | Channel unreads only (not active-view) | PASS |
| Migration 0017 applied | `[X] 0017_delete_activeview` | PASS |
| Production build | `built in 1m 16s` with no errors | PASS |

## Issues Encountered

None in the automated pre-checks.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Once human verification passes all 7 tests, Phase 5 is complete and Phase 6 (UI audio enhancements) can begin. No blockers identified.
