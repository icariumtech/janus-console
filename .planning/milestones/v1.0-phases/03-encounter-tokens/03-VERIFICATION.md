# Phase 03: Encounter Tokens Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** GM can place and move tokens on encounter maps with live player updates
**Verified:** 2026-02-17T04:00:00Z
**Status:** human_needed (all automated checks pass; 5 items require human testing)
**Re-verification:** Yes — after UAT (8 failures) and gap closure (03-04 plan)

## Context

Phase 03 was executed across 4 sub-plans:
- **03-01**: Backend token data layer (Django models, API endpoints, TypeScript types)
- **03-02**: Token rendering system (Token, TokenStatusOverlay, TokenPopup, TokenLayer components)
- **03-03**: GM token controls (TokenPalette, TokenImageGallery, MapPreview drop target, drag-to-move)
- **03-04**: UAT gap closure (5 root causes, 8 UAT test failures)

The previous VERIFICATION.md (03-03-VERIFICATION.md) was written before UAT and reflected code that hadn't been tested. UAT revealed 8 failures. This report verifies the final state after gap closure commits `a0723b5` and `0faa64f`.

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | GM can drag a token from the palette onto the encounter map to place it | VERIFIED | TokenPalette.tsx has `draggable="true"` with `handleDragStart` setting dataTransfer JSON; MapPreview.tsx has `onDragOver` + `onDrop` handlers wired to SVG element (lines 623-624) |
| 2 | Drag preview shows token-sized image (not full-size portrait) | VERIFIED | TokenPalette.tsx `handleDragStart` creates a 40x40 canvas, draws circular-clipped image, calls `setDragImage(canvas, 20, 20)` (lines 153-188); commit `a0723b5` confirmed |
| 3 | Palette shows pre-configured templates from crew roster and NPCs | VERIFIED | TokenPalette.tsx calls `encounterApi.getTokenImages()` on mount to populate templates array; backend `api_encounter_token_images` endpoint exists at `/api/gm/encounter/token-images/` |
| 4 | Palette has custom token option for ad-hoc entries | VERIFIED | TokenPalette.tsx has custom token section with name input, type selector, image gallery, and Create button; `handleCreateCustom` adds to `templates` array via `setTemplates(prev => [...prev, customTemplate])` (line 126) |
| 5 | GM selects token image from gallery of available images | VERIFIED | TokenImageGallery.tsx (333 lines) fetches images via `encounterApi.getTokenImages()`, displays grouped thumbnails, fires `onSelect` callback |
| 6 | Tokens snap to grid cells on placement and movement | VERIFIED | `svgCoordinates.ts` exports `snapToGrid`, `screenToSVG`, `getGridCell`; MapPreview uses `getGridCell()` in `onDrop` (line 257); TokenLayer uses `snapToGrid` in mouse move handler (lines 123-124) |
| 7 | Two tokens cannot occupy the same grid cell | VERIFIED | MapPreview.tsx `isCellOccupied()` callback (lines 225-228); checked in `handleDrop` (line 260) with user-facing warning message via `messageApi.warning` |
| 8 | Tokens can only be placed in revealed rooms | VERIFIED | MapPreview.tsx `findRoomAtCell()` determines containing room; room visibility checked before placement (lines 268-277); TokenLayer drag-to-move checks same constraint |
| 9 | GM can drag-to-move existing tokens with snap-to-grid | VERIFIED | TokenLayer.tsx implements drag state tracking, `handleTokenDragStart`, mouse move with `screenToSVG` + `snapToGrid`, ghost token at snapped position, `onTokenMove` called on mouse up |
| 10 | Tokens in unrevealed rooms hidden from player view | VERIFIED | TokenLayer.tsx visibility filter changed from `!== false` to `=== true` (line 68); GM view bypasses filter via `isGM` check (line 61-64); commit `0faa64f` confirmed |
| 11 | Clicking token in GM console shows popup with status toggles and remove button | VERIFIED | MapPreview.tsx adds `selectedTokenId` state (line 121) and passes `selectedTokenId={selectedTokenId}` + `onTokenSelect={setSelectedTokenId}` to TokenLayer (lines 665-666); commit `0faa64f` confirmed |
| 12 | Clear All Tokens with confirmation prompt | VERIFIED | TokenPalette.tsx `handleClearAll` uses `Modal.confirm` (line 193); on confirm calls `encounterApi.clearAllTokens()` (line 201); button shows token count (line 488) |
| 13 | Token state syncs to player terminal via polling | VERIFIED | ActiveView API returns `encounter_tokens` (views.py line 199); all token mutations update `active_view.encounter_tokens` in DB; player terminal polls `/api/active-view/` every 2 seconds |

**Score:** 11/11 primary must-haves verified (13/13 including UAT gap closure truths)

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Drag Preview Size and Visual Quality

**Test:** Open GM Console with an encounter loaded. Drag a crew template card from the TOKENS palette.
**Expected:** The drag ghost should show a small 40x40px circular token image (not the full-size portrait). The image should be clipped in a circle matching the rendered token appearance.
**Why human:** Canvas-based drag preview visual fidelity cannot be verified programmatically. Browser rendering of `setDragImage` with canvas varies by platform.

#### 2. Custom Token Grid Placement

**Test:** In the TOKENS palette custom token section, enter a name (e.g., "Alien Queen"), select type "Creature", optionally select an image from gallery, click CREATE. Observe the template grid.
**Expected:** A new card for "Alien Queen" appears in the template grid above the custom section. The card is draggable and can be dropped onto the map to place the token.
**Why human:** Dynamic template grid update must be visually confirmed. The `setTemplates` state update triggers React re-render but UI appearance needs human judgment.

#### 3. GM Console Token Popup Controls

**Test:** Place a token on the encounter map via drag-drop. Click the placed token on the GM console map preview.
**Expected:** An inline popup appears showing: token name, type badge, status toggles for wounded/panicked/stunned (as checkboxes or buttons), and a red REMOVE button. Toggling a status should change the token's visual overlay. REMOVE should delete the token from the map.
**Why human:** Popup rendering, positioning, and interactivity require live testing. This was a major UAT failure (test 11) and the fix (selectedTokenId state) must be confirmed working.

#### 4. Token Visibility on Room Hide — Player Terminal

**Test:** Open both GM Console (`/gmconsole/`) and Player Terminal (`/terminal/`) in separate browser windows. Place a token in a visible room. Confirm it appears on the player terminal. Now in GM Console, toggle that room to hidden (unrevealed). Wait up to 2 seconds.
**Expected:** The token should disappear from the player terminal view. The GM console should still display the token (GM always sees all tokens).
**Why human:** Cross-browser, two-context test. The visibility filter fix (`=== true`) is confirmed in code, but the end-to-end behavior (including room_id tracking in token data) requires live verification.

#### 5. Player Terminal Live Sync

**Test:** Place a token on the GM console encounter map. Observe the player terminal (polling every 2 seconds).
**Expected:** Within 2 seconds, the token appears on the player terminal encounter map at the same grid position, with correct type color (amber for player, teal for NPC, red for creature, gray for object). Players see tokens as read-only (no popup edit controls).
**Why human:** Multi-device polling behavior and cross-view rendering fidelity require live testing with server running.

### Gaps Summary

No automated gaps detected. All 11 phase must-haves are verified in code. All 5 UAT root causes have confirmed fixes in the codebase (commits `a0723b5` and `0faa64f`). TypeScript compiles with 0 errors.

The 5 human verification items were previously reported as UAT failures. The automated code analysis confirms the fixes are present and correctly wired. Human re-testing is needed to confirm the gap closure actually resolves the user-reported issues in the running application.

**Phase 03 goal ("GM can place and move tokens on encounter maps with live player updates") is fully implemented.** The complete token workflow is wired end-to-end: palette -> drag -> map drop -> grid snap -> overlap check -> room check -> API save -> DB persist -> polling -> player terminal display.
