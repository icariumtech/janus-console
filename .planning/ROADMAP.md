### 🚧 v3.0 Better Deckplans (Phase 31–33)

- [x] Phase 29: Interactive deckplan map editor with live preview, YAML sync, and POI placement — completed 2026-06-30
  - **Goal:** Give the GM a visual way to author deckplan maps — consolidate on `deckplan.yaml` as the sole format, then extend the GM Console file editor with a live map preview, deck selector, click-to-jump, and POI placement/move via surgical text edits.
  - **Depends on:** Phase 28
  - **Requirements**: EDIT-01, EDIT-02, EDIT-03, EDIT-04, EDIT-05, EDIT-06
  - **Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
    1. Every location's deckplan loads from `deckplan.yaml` only — somnus migrated, legacy `map/manifest.yaml` + per-deck `map/*.yaml` loaders and fallback branches removed
    2. GM opens a `deckplan.yaml` in the file editor and sees a live rendered map preview below Monaco
    3. GM can switch which deck the preview renders via a deck selector
    4. GM clicks a room or POI on the preview and Monaco reveals + highlights the corresponding YAML line
    5. GM can drag a POI to move it or click an empty cell to add a POI stub, with both written back as surgical text patches (no reserialize)
  - **Plans:** 4 plans
    - [x] 29-01-PLAN.md — Consolidate on deckplan.yaml: migrate somnus, remove legacy loaders/fallbacks, schema doc + Django test (Wave 1)
    - [x] 29-02-PLAN.md — Pure YAML model + surgical edit builders (buildIdRangeMap/buildPositionEdit/buildAddPoiEdit) + vitest fixture/tests (Wave 2)
    - [x] 29-03-PLAN.md — Renderer POI editor props + DeckSelector + DeckplanPreviewPane mounted below Monaco (Wave 3)
    - [x] 29-04-PLAN.md — Wire click-to-jump, POI drag-to-move, click-to-add into Monaco + human-verify checkpoint (Wave 4)
  - Context: `.planning/phases/29-interactive-deckplan-map-editor-with-live-preview-yaml-sync-/29-CONTEXT.md`

- [x] Phase 30: AI map editing — element resolver + targeted edit MCP tools (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-06-06 (executed out of order, ahead of Phase 29; ad-interim, not v3.0 scope)
  - **Goal:** Let the JANUS AI edit a single deckplan element (room/corridor/door) and add/remove POIs without reading or rewriting the whole `deckplan.yaml`. Adds a server-side element resolver (id / slugified label / glob / fuzzy), an atomic targeted-edit endpoint (`set` field-merge + `add_poi`/`remove_poi` list verbs) with `data-changed` SSE, two MCP tools (`find_map_element`, `edit_map_element`), and deterministic human-readable element ids from `svg_to_map.py`. Independent of Phase 29's GUI editor but provides a resolution layer it can reuse.
  - **Requirements**: E-01–E-07 (defined in 30-CONTEXT.md)
  - Plans:
    - [x] 30-01-PLAN.md — Backend: `_resolve_map_element` + `api_gm_data_map_edit` endpoint + tests (Wave 1)
    - [x] 30-02-PLAN.md — Stable element ids — already satisfied (slug+unique exists; doors use derived id) (Wave 1)
    - [x] 30-03-PLAN.md — MCP tools `find_map_element`/`edit_map_element` + schema docs (Wave 2)

- [x] Phase 31: Deckplan Format — Per-Deck Hulls & Detail Linework
  - **Goal:** Extend the `deckplan.yaml` schema and `EncounterMapRenderer` so decks can declare their own hull geometry and decorative detail linework, with interior details gated by room reveal.
  - **Depends on:** Phase 29 (deckplan.yaml is the sole format; editor preview benefits from but does not require this)
  - **Requirements**: HULL-01, HULL-02, DET-01, DET-03
  - **Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
    1. A deck in `deckplan.yaml` can declare its own hull polygon that overrides the location-level hull when present
    2. A deck hull can consist of multiple disjoint polygons (pods, nacelles, detached modules), and the renderer draws each correctly
    3. `deckplan.yaml` supports decorative detail linework attached to a room and to the deck exterior, and `EncounterMapRenderer` draws it
    4. Players viewing an unrevealed room do not see its interior detail linework; once revealed, the details appear
    5. Exterior/hull detail linework is always visible regardless of room reveal state
  - **Plans:** 3 plans
    - [x] 31-01-PLAN.md — Per-deck additive hulls: hullNormalizer + multi-polygon/holes rendering + patrol_gunboat two-deck testbed + hull schema doc (Wave 1)
    - [x] 31-02-PLAN.md — Detail linework: DetailEntry + detailNormalizer gating + DetailsLayer + interior details inside the room reveal group + details schema doc (Wave 2)
    - [x] 31-03-PLAN.md — Backend thin-passthrough regression guard + human visual verification of all five success criteria (Wave 3)
  - **Note:** success criterion 1's "overrides" is refined to **additive** semantics per 31-CONTEXT.md D-02 — a deck hull adds geometry to the shared silhouette and never replaces it.
  - **UI hint**: yes
  - Context: `.planning/phases/31-deckplan-format-per-deck-hulls-detail-linework/31-CONTEXT.md`

- [ ] Phase 32: SVG Converter — Details, Per-Deck Hulls, Circular Rooms
  - **Goal:** Extend `tools/svg_to_map.py` to emit the new Phase 31 schema fields and circular rooms, so Inkscape-authored decks convert directly into richer `deckplan.yaml` output.
  - **Depends on:** Phase 31 (emits the format Phase 31 defines)
  - **Requirements**: DET-02, HULL-03, CIRC-01
  - **Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
    1. Running `svg_to_map.py` on an SVG with a "Details" sublayer produces detail linework entries in the output `deckplan.yaml`, correctly associated with their room or the deck exterior
    2. Running `svg_to_map.py` on an SVG with per-deck "Hull" sublayers produces per-deck hull polygons (including multi-polygon hulls) in the output
    3. Running `svg_to_map.py` on an SVG containing `<circle>`/`<ellipse>` elements in a room layer produces `circle` room entries in the output, renderable by the existing renderer
    4. Converted output remains valid per `docs/schemas/schema-encounters.md`, updated in the same commit as the format change
  - **Plans:** 0 plans (run `/gsd:plan-phase 32` to break down)

- [ ] Phase 33: Isometric View
  - **Goal:** Add an isometric projection alongside the existing top-down view, with a live toggle on both the player encounter view and the GM console map.
  - **Depends on:** Phase 31 (details/hulls must project correctly in iso)
  - **Requirements**: ISO-01, ISO-02, ISO-03
  - **Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
    1. Any deckplan can render in an isometric projection via the existing `gridProjection`/`mapView` seam — rooms, doors, vents, POIs, tokens, and detail linework all appear correctly positioned
    2. Players can toggle the encounter view between top-down and isometric, with the change applying live (a cut, not an animated transition)
    3. The GM can independently toggle the GM console map between top-down and isometric, live
  - **Plans:** 0 plans (run `/gsd:plan-phase 33` to break down)
  - **UI hint**: yes
