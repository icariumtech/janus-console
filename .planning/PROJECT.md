# Mothership GM Terminal

## What This Is

A retro-futuristic game master tool for running Mothership RPG campaigns. Full-stack web app (Django + React/TypeScript) that serves as an interactive command center with atmospheric CRT-styled interfaces, 3D galaxy maps, grid-based encounter maps with token tracking, CHARON AI terminal, NPC portrait overlays, real-time SSE state push, and a structured campaign data system.

## Core Value

Give the GM a single tool that enhances the tabletop experience with atmospheric digital interfaces — maps, messaging, and information displays — without interrupting gameplay flow.

## Current State

**Shipped:** v1.0 MVP (2026-05-07) · v2.0 AI Tooling (2026-06-12) · **Active:** v3.0 Better Deckplans — Phase 31 (Deckplan Format — Per-Deck Hulls & Detail Linework) complete; Phase 32 (SVG Converter) and Phase 33 (Isometric View) remain

- Phases 1–31 complete · v2.0 archived 2026-06-12
- ~40k LOC first-party source (TypeScript + Python) + standalone `janus-skills` repo (10 Claude Code skills, schema resources, install.sh)
- Tech stack: Django 5.2.7, React 19, TypeScript, Vite 5.4, React Three Fiber 9.0, Zustand, GSAP, Ant Design 6.1
- Data: YAML/Markdown files, flat location directory, per-entity character files
- Deployed: Docker image on GHCR, docker-compose homelab deploy (icarium), MCP server on port 8001

Key systems shipped in v2.0:
- Encounter renderer deepening — four-module geometry stack, canonical Door model, reveal-cascade scheduler, interaction hooks; Vitest infrastructure
- Containerization — multi-stage Docker image, external data mount, GHCR CI publish
- JANUS MCP server (FastMCP HTTP) — campaign read/write tools delegating to Django REST, plus image upload and targeted map-element editing (Phase 30)
- janus-skills repo — Claude Code skills for AI-driven campaign data management
- Map playback controls (Chronoscope) + map polish on 3D views
- GM Console file editor — Monaco-based data-directory editing with `data-changed` SSE auto-refresh on player terminals

Key systems shipped in v1.0:
- Grid-based encounter maps with wall-segment rendering and room reveal
- GM Console redesigned as view-driven architecture (ViewRail/ToolRail/SlideOutPanel)
- Real-time SSE push replacing 2s polling; ActiveView in-memory store
- Atmospheric CRT animations across all player-facing transitions
- Ship STATUS tab with dual terminal panels, reactor, and consumable resource tracking
- Encounter token system (placement, movement, status indicators)
- NPC portrait overlays on player terminal
- Flat location hierarchy with orbit map self-registration

## Current Milestone: v3.0 Better Deckplans

**Goal:** Make deckplan maps richer and easier to author — a visual editor in the GM Console, blueprint-grade visual detail, and an isometric presentation mode.

**Target features:**
- Interactive deckplan editor (Phase 29 context ready) — legacy `map/` format removal, live preview under Monaco, deck selector, map→YAML click-to-jump, POI placement via surgical text edits
- Map detail system — decorative linework (room interiors + hull greebles) authored in Inkscape "Details" sublayers, converted by `svg_to_map.py`; room details tied to room reveal, exterior details always visible
- Per-deck hull polygons — each deck may declare its own hull outline
- Circular room conversion — `svg_to_map.py` emits `circle` rooms from SVG circles/ellipses (renderer already supports them)
- Isometric view — iso projection behind the `gridProjection`/`mapView` seam, live top-down↔iso toggle on player + GM views

**Key constraints:** surgical YAML edits only (no reserialize); schema-sync rule on every format change.

### Active

- [ ] Circular room SVG conversion — v3.0
- [ ] Isometric view toggle (player + GM) — v3.0
- [ ] UI audio — click sounds, transition effects, ambient atmosphere (AUDI-01..03, deferred from v1.0; not in v3.0)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile native app — web-first, mobile responsive is enough
- Player character sheet editing — read-only for now
- Player-controlled token movement — GM-controlled paradigm; Mothership is theater-of-mind
- Animated token movement — unnecessary visual complexity for CRT aesthetic
- AI-generated NPC portraits — GM curates portrait assets

## Context

- Developed collaboratively between GM and Claude Code
- Tech stack: Django 5.2.7, React 19, TypeScript, Vite 5.4, React Three Fiber 9.0, Zustand, GSAP, Ant Design 6.1
- Data stored as YAML + Markdown files in structured directory hierarchy (git-friendly)
- SQLite stores only broadcast Messages (persistent); all ephemeral GM state in in-memory ActiveView store
- Campaign data: `data/` directory — `data/galaxy/` for celestial bodies, `data/locations/` for non-celestial, `data/campaign/` for session/crew/NPC files
- Codebase map exists at `.planning/codebase/`
- UI follows Alien Romulus (2024) aesthetic — muted multi-color palette, monospaced fonts, angular panels
- Players access from phones/tablets at the gaming table
- SSE broadcaster uses named events: `activeview`, `shipstatus`, `bridge` — each with dedicated `useSSE` listeners

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Must stay Django + React/TypeScript + R3F — significant existing investment
- **File-based data**: Campaign data must remain YAML/Markdown files, not migrated to DB
- **CRT aesthetic**: All new UI must follow the established teal/amber design system (STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- **Performance**: 3D scenes must maintain smooth framerates; new features should not compete with RAF loop
- **Mobile-friendly**: All player-facing views must work on phones/tablets

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| File-based data over DB | Git-friendly, no sync required, easy to edit manually | ✓ Good |
| React Three Fiber over imperative Three.js | Declarative, less code, unified RAF loop | ✓ Good |
| Zustand for 3D scene state | Single source of truth, no prop drilling, performant selectors | ✓ Good |
| SSE over WebSockets | Named-event fan-out, simpler than WS, sufficient for tabletop pace | ✓ Good |
| In-memory ActiveView store | Eliminates DB write bottleneck; ephemeral state doesn't need persistence | ✓ Good |
| Wall-segment algorithm for grid maps | Edge-count exclusion naturally handles L/T/U shapes; no explicit interior-edge config | ✓ Good |
| View-driven GM Console (GMViewType local state) | DISPLAY button is the only action that reaches server; no API chatter | ✓ Good |
| Flat location directory | Self-registration into orbit maps eliminates galaxy tree traversal | ✓ Good |
| Per-entity character files | Glob-based loading; better for manual editing and AI token cost | ✓ Good |
| Ant Design for layout/forms | Rapid development, consistent components | ✓ Good |
| PORT-03 design revert | NPCPortraitOverlay not needed on GM screen; toggle controls in NPC Portraits panel are sufficient | ✓ Accepted |
| api_bridge_selection intentionally public | Player terminal is the caller; player auth not yet implemented; ephemeral write-only, low risk | ✓ Accepted |
| MCP server delegates to Django REST (no direct file access) | Single write path with traversal guard + atomic YAML write; SSE broadcast for free | ✓ Good |
| janus-skills as standalone repo with symlink installer | Skills versioned independently; schema docs synced from main repo via CI | ✓ Good |
| Monaco editor for GM file editing | Full YAML/MD editing in browser; eliminates SSH round-trips during play | ✓ Good |
| Generic `data-changed` SSE event | One event covers all AI/GM data writes; player terminals re-fetch active view | ✓ Good |
| Targeted map-element edit endpoint (resolver + verbs) | AI edits one room/door/POI without rewriting deckplan.yaml; 404/409 return suggestions instead of failing | ✓ Good |
| Phase 26 shipped ad-hoc without plans | Small polish pass; formal planning overhead not justified | ✓ Accepted |
| Per-deck hulls are additive, not override | Roadmap originally said a deck hull "overrides" the shared silhouette; discussion refined this so the shared outline always renders and deck hulls add geometry on top — avoids a deck hull ever hiding the ship's baseline shape | ✓ Good |
